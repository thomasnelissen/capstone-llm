The outputs are several excel files. I would like to be able to execute scheduled monitored batch jobs with parallel computation (I mean not as sequential as what I'm doing with pandas), once a month.</p>\n\n<p>I don't really know Beam or Airflow, I quickly read through the docs and it seems that both can achieve that. Which one should I use ? </p>\n","answer":"<p>The other answers are quite technical and hard to understand. I was in your position before so I'll explain in <em>simple terms</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Airflow</strong> can do <em>anything</em>. It has <code>BashOperator</code> and <code>PythonOperator</code> which means it can run any bash script or any Python script.<br />\nIt is a way to organize (setup complicated data pipeline DAGs), schedule, monitor, trigger re-runs of data pipelines, in a easy-to-view and use UI.<br />\nAlso, it is easy to setup and everything is in familiar Python code.<br />\nDoing pipelines in an organized manner (i.e using Airflow) means you don't waste time debugging a mess of data processing (<code>cron</code>) scripts all over the place.<br />\nNowadays (roughly year 2020 onwards), we call it an <strong>orchestration</strong> tool.</p>\n<p><strong>Apache Beam</strong> is a wrapper for the many data processing frameworks (Spark, Flink etc.) out there.<br />\nThe intent is so you just learn Beam and can run on multiple backends (Beam runners).<br />\nIf you are familiar with Keras and TensorFlow/Theano/Torch, the relationship between Keras and its backends is similar to the relationship between Beam and its data processing backends.</p>\n<p>Google Cloud Platform's Cloud Dataflow is one backend for running Beam on.<br />\nThey call it the <a href=\"https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runners/dataflow/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dataflow runner</a>.</p>\n<p>GCP's offering, <strong>Cloud Composer</strong>, is a <strong>managed Airflow implementation</strong> as a service, running in a Kubernetes cluster in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE).</p>\n<p>So you can either:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>manual Airflow implementation, doing data processing on the instance itself (if your data is small (or your instance is powerful enough), you can process data on the machine running Airflow. This is why many are confused if Airflow can process data or not)</li>\n<li>manual Airflow implementation calling Beam jobs</li>\n<li>Cloud Composer (managed Airflow as a service) calling jobs in Cloud Dataflow</li>\n<li>Cloud Composer running data processing containers in Composer's Kubernetes cluster environment itself, using Airflow's <code>KubernetesPodOperator (KPO)</code></li>\n<li>Cloud Composer running data processing containers in Composer's Kubernetes cluster environment with Airflow's <code>KPO</code>, but this time in a better <strong>isolated</strong> fashion by creating a new node-pool and specifying that the <code>KPO</code> pods are to be run in the new node-pool</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>My personal experience</strong>:<br />\nAirflow is lightweight and not difficult to learn (easy to implement), you should use it for your data pipelines whenever possible.<br />\nAlso, since many companies are looking for experience using Airflow, if you're looking to be a data engineer you should probably learn it<br />\nAlso, managed Airflow (I've only used GCP's Composer so far) is much more convenient than running Airflow yourself, and managing the airflow <code>webserver</code> and <code>scheduler</code> processes.</p>\n"}

{"title":"Airflow versus AWS Step Functions for workflow","question":"<p>I am working on a project that grabs a set of input data from AWS S3, pre-processes and divvies it up, spins up 10K batch containers to process the divvied data in parallel on AWS Batch, post-aggregates the data, and pushes it to S3.</p>\n<p>I already have software patterns from other projects for Airflow + Batch, but have not dealt with the scaling factors of 10k parallel tasks. Airflow is nice since I can look at which tasks failed and retry a task after debugging. But dealing with that many tasks on one Airflow EC2 instance seems like a barrier. Other option would be to have one task that kicks off the 10k containers and monitors it from there.</p>\n<p>I have no experience with Step Functions, but have heard it's AWS's Airflow. There looks to be plenty of patterns online for Step Functions + Batch. Does Step Functions seem like a good path to check out for my use case? Do you get the same insights on failing jobs / ability to retry tasks as you do with Airflow?</p>\n","answer":"<p>I have worked on both Apache Airflow and AWS Step Functions and here are some insights:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Step Functions provide out of the box maintenance. It has high availability and scalability that is required for your use-case, for Airflow we'll have to do to it with auto-scaling/load balancing on servers or containers (kubernetes).*</li>\n<li>Both Airflow and Step Functions have user friendly UI's. While Airflow supports multiple representations of the state machine, Step Functions only display state machine as DAG's.</li>\n<li>As of version 2.0, Airflow's Rest API is now <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/stable-rest-api-ref.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">stable</a>. AWS Step Functions are also supported by a range of production graded cli and <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/tools/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">SDK's</a>.</li>\n<li>Airflow has server costs while Step Functions have 4000/month free step executions (free tier) and $0.000025/step after that. e.g. if you use 10K steps for AWS Batch that run once daily, you will be priced $0.25 per day ($7.5 per month). The price for Airflow server (t2.large ec2 1 year reserved instance) is $41.98 per month. We will have to use AWS Batch for either case.**</li>\n<li>AWS Batch can integrate to both <a href=\"https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/_api/airflow/contrib/operators/awsbatch_operator/index.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Airflow</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-batch.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Step Functions</a>.</li>\n<li>You can clear and rerun a failed task in Apache Airflow, but in Step Functions you will have to create a <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/resume-aws-step-functions-from-any-state/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">custom implementation</a> to handle that. You may handle <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-error-handling.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">automated retries with back-offs</a> in Step Functions definition as well.</li>\n<li>For failed task in Step Functions you will get a visual representation of failed state and the detailed message when you click it. You may also use aws cli or sdk to get the details.</li>\n<li>Step Functions use easy to use JSON as state machine definition, while Airflow uses Python script.</li>\n<li>Step Functions support <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/05/aws-step-functions-support-callback-patterns/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">async callbacks</a>, i.e. state machine pauses until an external source notifies it to resume. While Airflow has <a href=\"https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/AIRFLOW/AIP-28%3A+Add+AsyncExecutor+option\" rel=\"noreferrer\">yet to add</a> this feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, I see more advantages of using AWS Step Functions. You will have to consider maintenance cost and development cost for both services as per your use case.</p>\n<p><strong>UPDATES</strong> (AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow Service):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>*With AWS Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow service, you can offload deployment, maintenance, autoscaling/load balancing and security of your Airflow Service to AWS. But please consider the version number you're willing to settle for, as AWS managed services are mostly behind the latest version. (e.g. As of March 08, 2021, the latest version of open source airflow is 2.01, while MWAA allows version 1.10.12)</li>\n<li>**MWAA costs on environment, instance and storage. <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow/pricing/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">More details here</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n"}

The deployment is done with the click of a button in Bamboo UI thanks to the shell script mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Because you have included the DAG version in your file name, the previous version of your DAG file is not overwritten in the DAG folder so you can easily come back to it</li>\n<li>When your new DAG file is loaded in Airflow you can recognize it in the UI thanks to the version number.</li>\n<li>Because your DAG file name = DAG Id you could even improve the deployment script by adding some Airflow command line to automatically switch ON your new DAGs once they are deployed.</li>\n<li>Because every version of the DAGs is historicized in Git, we can always comeback to previous versions if needed.</li>\n</ol>\n"}
